# despit

Single use chat rooms

Using this as an attempt to learn socket.io and sharpen webdev skills :D

The setup of this project is very similar to that of https://github.com/ApocalypseCalculator/Feck , so check that out if you are looking to install this

The site icon was taken off a Google search, I did not make it. I also used the socket.io example as a base for building my chat room features

For those who know my identity, a hosted version is at the `despit` subdomain of my website
